# Idea for CodeFunDo++ 2018
## The idea
We plan to locate the epicentre of an earthquake precisely by taking input from 3 seismic stations

## Working
* The site takes input from seismic stations
* Finds the distace of origin of the earthquake
* Sends instant emails to every subscribes user and emails SMS and emails to people residing (GPS Location) in that area
* Finds nearest hositals and health centres for rescues and detects open areas to gather from GPS near the affected region

## Getting Started
* User needs to register himself/herself with the webapp

## Technologies Used
* Django to build webapp
* GPS API: To find real time location
* SMS API: To send SOS Alert
