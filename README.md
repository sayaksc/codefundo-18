# Idea for CodeFunDo++ 2018
## The idea
We plan to locate the epicentre of an earthquake precisely by taking input from 3 seismic stations

## Working
* The site takes input from seismic stations
* Finds the distace of origin of the earthquake by taking the distance from each seismic station by studying the lag between primary and secondary waves
* Atleast 3 seismic stations required to precisely determine the epicentre of the earthquake
* Sends instant emails to every subscribes user and emails SMS and emails to people residing (GPS Location) in that area
* Finds nearest hositals and health centres for rescues and detects open areas to gather from GPS near the affected region

## Real Time Values
* Values taken from IRIS Data Services

## Getting Started
* User needs to register himself/herself with the webapp ( http://ds.iris.edu/ds/ )
* 

## Technologies Used
* Django to build webapp
* GPS API: To find real time location
* SMS API: To send SOS Alert
